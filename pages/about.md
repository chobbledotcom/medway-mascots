# About Medway Mascots

Welcome to Medway Mascots – your local, reliable, and safety-focused inflatable hire company based in South East London. We've been bringing joy and energy to parties, school events, corporate functions, and fundraisers since 2013, and we're proud to serve communities across Bexleyheath, Dartford, Welling, Sidcup, Erith, Crayford, Swanley and surrounding areas.

What started as a small family-run business has grown into one of the most recognisable names in local event hire. But while our product range has expanded significantly over the years, our values have stayed exactly the same: reliable service, straightforward pricing, a strong focus on safety, and a team that genuinely cares about helping you have a smooth, stress-free hire experience.

## Why Choose Medway Mascots?

We know there are a lot of hire companies out there – so why do so many customers come back to Medway Mascots again and again?

### Extensive Product Range

We started with just a few bouncy castles, but now we stock dozens of inflatables, soft play sets, machines, props, and accessories.

**Bouncy Castles:** From themed favourites like the Spiderman Red & Blue Bounce & Slide Bouncy Castle to colourful classics such as the Slim Jungle Bouncy Castle, we have castles to suit every age group and venue size.

**Soft Play:** Perfect for toddlers and younger children, our soft play equipment creates safe, engaging play areas.

**Party Extras:** Complete your event with our popcorn machines, slush makers, photo booths, LED furniture, and mascot costumes.

### Safety First

Safety isn't just a priority – it's fundamental to everything we do. All our equipment is regularly inspected, properly maintained, and fully insured. We provide comprehensive safety briefings and ensure every hire meets the highest safety standards.

### Local Knowledge, Personal Service

As a local business, we understand the unique needs of our community. From navigating narrow driveways in Sidcup to setting up in the parks of Bexleyheath, our experienced team knows how to make your event run smoothly.

### Straightforward Pricing

No hidden fees, no surprise charges. Our pricing is transparent and competitive, with flexible packages to suit different budgets and requirements.

## Serving Your Community

We're proud to be part of the South East London and Kent community, bringing smiles to thousands of events each year. Whether it's a child's birthday party in your back garden, a school fete, a corporate fun day, or a charity fundraiser, we have the experience and equipment to make it memorable.
