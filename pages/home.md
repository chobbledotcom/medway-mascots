# Professional Mascot Costume Hire in Medway, Kent and South East London

Welcome to Medway Mascots

If you’re looking for reliable, friendly and affordable mascot hire Medway, you’re in exactly the right place. At Medway Mascots, we provide a growing range of high-quality mascot costumes for children’s parties, family events, schools, nurseries and local celebrations across Medway and surrounding areas.

We’re a local, Medway-based business, not a national courier-only company. That means clearer pricing, easier collections, and real people you can speak to before your event. Whether you’re planning a birthday party at home, a school fun day, or a community event, our mascot hire service is designed to be simple, flexible and stress-free.

## Local Mascot Hire in Medway You Can Trust

Our mascot hire Medway service is built around local families and organisers. We don’t believe in posting costumes out nationwide as standard — instead, we focus on safe, reliable local hire with clear options that suit parents and event organisers alike.

You can:

Collect your mascot costume locally from our Gillingham address

Choose low-cost local delivery and collection if you prefer convenience

Hire with confidence knowing costumes are checked, cleaned and ready for use

This local-first approach allows us to keep prices fair while offering a much more personal service than larger national companies.

## Our Character Collection

Our mascot collection has been carefully chosen to suit children’s parties, family events and local celebrations across Medway and surrounding areas. We offer a fantastic mix of popular TV characters, party favourites and fun costume options that children instantly recognise and love. From favourites like Bluey and Bingo, Chase, Marshall and Skye, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Mario and Luigi, through to fun options like a Minion, Stitch, Pink Unicorn and even a Lion, there’s something to suit almost every party theme.

We also offer seasonal and event-friendly mascots, including The Grinch and Elf on the Shelf, making our collection ideal for Christmas parties and festive events. Every mascot costume is checked, cleaned and well maintained before hire, giving you confidence that it’s ready for photos, fun and unforgettable moments. Whether you’re hosting a birthday party at home or organising a school or community event, our mascot collection offers a reliable, local and hassle-free alternative to national courier-based companies.
