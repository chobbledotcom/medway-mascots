💙 How our Mascot hire works 💙

Here’s how the hire process works :

**Collection Or Delivery?**

### Collection Options:

Our mascots and costumes can be collected directly from **Twydall, Gillingham, ME8** at an agreed time then returned to the same address when the hire is complete. Alternatively, if you are hiring a bouncy castle or soft play package with us from our other website Beyond Bounce the mascot can be delivered alongside your booking free of charge.

Just press the green button below to book online

### Delivery Options:

Delivery is provided through our preferred logistics partner Parcel Force and for **businesses and charities only**. The cost for this service is £25 for delivery and collection. You may have to return the mascot to the nearest post office or allow us to book a collection slot from you directly.

Get in Touch with us through our enquiry form or email [info@medwaymascots.co.uk](mailto:info@medwaymascots.co.uk) to book for a delivery outside of Kent if you're a business or charity.

Deposit and Payment :

Our mascots are £50 to self hire (collect and wear yourself) This can be paid online, through a payment link or by an invoice for regular business customers only.

When booking online, please pay the £20 booking fee / deposit to reserve your booking. You may pay the balance in cash for local collections, deliveries or by payment link.

A £50 cash or bank transfer security deposit is also required upon delivery/collection of the mascot. This deposit will be returned in full once the mascot costume is returned/collected and has been inspected to ensure it is complete and in good condition.
