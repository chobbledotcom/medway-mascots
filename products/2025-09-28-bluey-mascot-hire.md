💙 What’s included with our Mascot Hire? 💙

High quality Bluey mascot costume, including gloves and feet. Please note, this is a costume hire only. Our mascots are cleaned between each hire, examined and repaired so you can expect nothing but the best when hiring from us! Our mascots are one size fits all but please note we do recommend they are most suited to adults size small - large and under 1.8 m in height for the most comfortable fit.

💙 How our Mascot hire works 💙

Here’s how the hire process works :

**Collection Or Delivery?**

### Collection Options:

Our mascots and costumes can be collected directly from **Twydall, Gillingham, ME8** at an agreed time then returned to the same address when the hire is complete. Alternatively, if you are hiring a bouncy castle or soft play package with us from our other website Beyond Bounce the mascot can be delivered alongside your booking free of charge.

### Delivery Options:

Delivery is provided through our preferred logistics partner Parcel Force and for **businesses and charities only**. The cost for this service is £25 for delivery and collection and you may have to return the mascot to the nearest post office or allow us to book a collection slot from you directly.

Deposit and Payment :

Our mascots are £50 to self hire (collect and wear yourself) This can be paid online, through a payment link or by an invoice for regular business customers only.

A £50 cash security deposit is required upon delivery / collection of the mascot. This deposit will be returned in full once the mascot costume is returned/collected and has been inspected to ensure it is complete and in good condition.

💙 Why Choose Our Bluey Mascot Hire? 💙

Fun, family friendly entertainment. Perfect for party photos and meet & greets. A unique way to surprise your little Bluey fan! High quality costumes.
