## Anna Mascot Costume Hire

The Anna mascot costume features the Disney Frozen princess character for birthday parties, school events, and celebrations across Kent. This adult-sized costume allows someone to dress as Anna of Arendelle and interact with children at your event.

The costume fits up to size 12/14 and suits both small gatherings and larger celebrations. Anna can participate in party activities, pose for photographs, and engage with children during entertainment segments.

## Frozen Character Collection

Anna works well with other Frozen mascot costumes including [Elsa](/products/elsa-mascot-costume/), [Olaf](/products/olaf-mascot-costume/), and [Sven](/products/sven-reindeer-mascot-costume/) to recreate scenes from the Disney movies. You can hire multiple characters to provide a complete Frozen experience for your guests.

## Package Options

When combined with bouncy castle or soft play hire, the Anna costume costs £20. You can also add Frozen-themed inflatables, party equipment, and refreshment services to create a comprehensive party package.
