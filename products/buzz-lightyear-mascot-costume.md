## Buzz Lightyear Mascot Costume Hire

The Buzz Lightyear mascot costume brings the Space Ranger character from Disney's Toy Story to children's parties, school events, and celebrations throughout Kent. This adult-sized costume allows a family member or friend to dress as the space-faring toy who believes he's a real Space Ranger.

The costume fits up to size 12/14 and includes Buzz's distinctive white and green space suit with purple accents, retractable wings, and helmet design. Children can interact with Buzz during party games, photo sessions, and themed activities while he demonstrates his space ranger moves and catchphrases.

## Complete Your Toy Story Adventure

The Buzz Lightyear costume pairs with other Toy Story characters including [Woody](/products/woody-mascot-costume/) and [Jessie](/products/toy-story-jessie-mascot/) to recreate Andy's toy box at your event. You can hire multiple Toy Story characters together or combine them with Western-themed party decorations and activities.

When hired alongside bouncy castle or soft play packages, mascot costume hire costs just £20. Additional party equipment includes popcorn machines, sweet carts, and themed party supplies to enhance your Toy Story celebration.
