## Elsa Mascot Costume Hire

The Elsa mascot costume brings the Disney Frozen character to birthday parties, school events, and celebrations throughout Kent. This adult-sized costume allows a family member or friend to dress as the ice queen character from Arendelle.

The costume fits up to size 12/14 and works well for photo opportunities, meet-and-greet sessions, and interactive party activities. Children can sing along to Frozen songs while Elsa participates in party games and entertainment.

## Complete Your Frozen Theme

The Elsa costume pairs with other Frozen characters including [Anna](/products/anna-mascot-costume/), [Olaf](/products/olaf-mascot-costume/), and [Sven](/products/sven-reindeer-mascot-costume/) to create a complete Disney experience. You can hire multiple characters together or add Frozen-themed inflatables and soft play equipment.

When hired alongside bouncy castle or soft play packages, mascot costume hire costs just £20. Additional party equipment includes popcorn machines, sweet carts, and slush machines with blue ice flavoring.
