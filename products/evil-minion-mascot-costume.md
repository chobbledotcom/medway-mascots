## Evil Minion Mascot Costume Hire

The Evil Minion mascot costume represents the purple-haired antagonist from Despicable Me 2. This adult-sized costume features the character's distinctive one-eyed design and wild purple hair that fans recognize from the film.

The costume completely conceals the wearer, maintaining the character illusion at birthday parties, school events, charity functions, and corporate gatherings. The mascot can greet guests, pose for photographs, and add theatrical mischief to your event.

## Character Design

The Evil Minion costume captures the transformed appearance of these characters after their mutation in Despicable Me 2. The design includes the purple fur, single goggle, and menacing expression that creates a playful villain experience.

Complete your Minion character collection by pairing this costume with our standard [One Eye Minion Mascot](/products/one-eye-minion-mascot-hire) or [Minion Two Eyes Costume](/products/minion-two-eyes-costume-hire) to recreate scenes from the movies.
