## Lippy Lipstick Mascot Costume

The Lippy Lipstick mascot costume brings the popular Shopkins character to birthday parties and events across Kent. This costume can greet guests at party entrances, participate in games, and make appearances during cake presentations.

## Hire Details

The costume costs £35 to hire. A £35 refundable deposit is required when collecting the costume to cover any potential damage. The deposit is returned when the costume comes back in its original condition.

Delivery is available alongside bouncy castle bookings or can be arranged separately for an additional fee. Alternatively, you can collect and return the costume directly from our address in Gravesend.
