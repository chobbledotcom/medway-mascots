## Luigi Mascot Costume Hire

Add Mario's brother Luigi to your event with our mascot costume hire service. This self-hire costume transforms any adult into the green-clad plumber from the Nintendo universe.

### Sizing and Fit

The costume accommodates adults up to 5ft 10in in height. Designed for slim, medium, and large builds. Extra large sizes are not available.

### Hire Options

The Luigi costume can be hired independently for collection from our Gravesend depot. It can also be delivered with any bouncy castle rental to complete your event setup.

### Character Pairing

Luigi works exceptionally well paired with our [Super Mario costume](/products/super-mario-costume-hire). Hiring both characters creates the full Mario Brothers duo that children recognize and love.
