## Minion Two Eyes Costume Hire

The Minion Two Eyes mascot costume features the popular characters Kevin and Dave from Despicable Me. This adult-sized costume includes the characteristic dual goggles that distinguish these characters from their one-eyed counterparts.

The costume provides complete concealment for the wearer, maintaining the character experience at birthday parties, school events, and corporate functions. The mascot can interact with guests, participate in activities, and pose for photographs throughout your event.

## Character Options

This costume represents Kevin and Dave, the well-known two-eyed Minions from the Despicable Me franchise. The design includes the classic yellow body, blue overalls, and dual goggle arrangement that children recognize from the films.

Enhance your Minion-themed event by combining this costume with our [One Eye Minion Mascot](/products/one-eye-minion-mascot-hire) featuring Stuart, or create contrast with our [Evil Minion Mascot Costume](/products/evil-minion-mascot-costume) for a complete character collection.
