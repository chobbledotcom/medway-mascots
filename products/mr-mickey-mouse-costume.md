## Mickey Mouse Mascot Costume Hire

Our Mickey Mouse mascot costume is available for hire across Kent and South East London. The adult-sized costume allows entertainers to portray Disney's most recognizable character at various events including birthday parties, school fetes, corporate functions, and charity fundraisers.

Mickey Mouse serves as an engaging entertainer for children and adults at meet-and-greet sessions, photo opportunities, and interactive activities. The costume includes the character's distinctive red shorts, yellow shoes, and oversized ears that children recognize instantly.

## Event Suitability

The Mickey Mouse costume works well at indoor and outdoor venues. Events that commonly feature Mickey Mouse include children's birthday parties, school celebrations, community festivals, and promotional events. The costume accommodates most adult sizes and includes ventilation for extended wear periods.
