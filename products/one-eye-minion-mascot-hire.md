## One Eye Minion Mascot Hire

The One Eye Minion mascot costume brings the recognizable yellow character from Despicable Me to your event. This adult-sized costume features the distinctive single goggle design that children recognize from the movies.

The costume conceals the wearer completely, maintaining the character illusion during parties, school events, and corporate gatherings. The mascot can interact with guests, pose for photographs, and participate in party activities.

## Character Details

The One Eye Minion costume represents characters like Stuart from the Despicable Me franchise. The design includes the classic yellow body, blue overalls, and single goggle that defines these popular characters.

For a complete Minion experience, consider our [Minion Two Eyes Costume](/products/minion-two-eyes-costume-hire) featuring Kevin or Dave, or add some mischief with our [Evil Minion Mascot Costume](/products/evil-minion-mascot-costume) for themed events.
