### Sizing and Fit

The costume fits adults up to 5ft 10in in height. Suitable for slim, medium, and large builds. Extra large sizes are not accommodated.

### Hire Options

You can hire the Super Mario costume as a standalone item with collection from our Gravesend depot. Alternatively, we can deliver it alongside any of our bouncy castles, including the Super Mario Castle or Super Mario Bouncy Castle and Slide.
