## Sven Reindeer Mascot Costume Hire

The Sven mascot costume features Kristoff's loyal reindeer companion from Disney's Frozen movies. This adult-sized costume brings the friendly reindeer character to birthday parties, Christmas celebrations, school events, and winter-themed gatherings across Kent.

Sven's costume design includes the character's antlers, brown fur coloring, and expressive face. The reindeer character can participate in party games, photo opportunities, and interactive entertainment with children at your event.

## Complete Frozen Experience

Sven pairs with other Frozen characters including [Elsa](/products/elsa-mascot-costume/), [Anna](/products/anna-mascot-costume/), and [Olaf](/products/olaf-mascot-costume/) to recreate the Arendelle story. Multiple character appearances create a comprehensive Disney Frozen theme for your celebration.

The costume fits up to size 12/14 and works well for both intimate gatherings and larger community events.

## Package Pricing

When hired alongside bouncy castle or soft play equipment, the Sven costume costs £20. You can combine the reindeer character with Frozen-themed inflatables, party equipment, and catering services to create a complete event package.
