## Toy Story Jessie Mascot Hire

The Jessie mascot costume brings the spirited cowgirl from Disney's Toy Story to children's parties, school events, and Western-themed celebrations throughout Kent. This adult-sized costume allows a family member or friend to dress as the energetic cowgirl toy who joins Woody and Buzz on their adventures.

The costume fits up to size 12/14 and includes Jessie's red and yellow checkered shirt, denim chaps, cowgirl hat with red yarn hair, and her characteristic boots. Children can participate in Western-themed games and activities while Jessie demonstrates her yodeling skills and cowgirl rope tricks during party entertainment.

## Round Up the Toy Story Gang

The Jessie costume complements other Toy Story characters including [Woody](/products/woody-mascot-costume/) and [Buzz Lightyear](/products/buzz-lightyear-mascot-costume/) to create the complete toy collection from Andy's room. You can hire multiple Toy Story characters together or combine them with Western party themes and cowgirl-themed activities and games.

When hired alongside bouncy castle or soft play packages, mascot costume hire costs just £20. Additional party equipment includes Western decorations, themed games, and party supplies to enhance your Wild West Toy Story celebration.
