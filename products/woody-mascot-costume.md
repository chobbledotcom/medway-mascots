## Woody Mascot Costume Hire

The Woody mascot costume brings the cowboy sheriff from Disney's Toy Story to children's parties, school events, and Western-themed celebrations throughout Kent. This adult-sized costume allows a family member or friend to dress as Andy's favorite toy and the leader of the toy gang.

The costume fits up to size 12/14 and includes Woody's yellow plaid shirt, cowhide vest, blue jeans, sheriff badge, and signature cowboy hat. Children can enjoy Western-themed activities with Woody while he demonstrates his lasso skills and shares stories from the frontier during party entertainment.

## Build Your Toy Story Collection

The Woody costume works alongside other Toy Story characters including [Buzz Lightyear](/products/buzz-lightyear-mascot-costume/) and [Jessie](/products/toy-story-jessie-mascot/) to bring the complete gang together at your event. You can hire multiple Toy Story characters or combine them with Western party themes and cowboy-themed games and activities.

When hired alongside bouncy castle or soft play packages, mascot costume hire costs just £20. Additional party equipment includes Western-themed decorations, games, and refreshment options to create an authentic Wild West experience.
