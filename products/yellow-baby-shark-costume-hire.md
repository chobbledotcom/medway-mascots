The Baby Shark costume includes the full character head and body suit, designed to represent the popular children's character from the Baby Shark song series. The yellow variant provides a distinctive appearance among the Baby Shark character family.

## Suitable Events

The costume works well for children's birthday parties, nursery events, school fetes, and themed celebrations. The character appeals particularly to younger children who are familiar with the Baby Shark songs and videos.

Activities include meet-and-greet sessions, photo opportunities, party games, and character interactions during events.
